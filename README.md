Point at a dog and you know what type of dog it is. Neat stuff

### Detection Algorithm
This system is using a personal modification on capsule networks which allows the routing system to apply itself recursively. Instead of being on a one-capsule multi-layer approach, this will embed entire other neural networks into the synapses of the system. This will hopefully allow for more of a "yolo" like effect in practice.

I'll put up some more info when I'm done. Novelties are hard....
